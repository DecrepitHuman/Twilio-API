# Twilio-API
This repo is dedicated towards monitoring servers via Flask-RestPlus and Twilio.

# How to run
To use this script as your own, you will need the following modules:  
⭐ flask  
⭐ flask_restplus  
⭐ twilio  
⭐ twilio.rest  
(All capitals should stay as written. flask_restplus and twilio.rest will probably be installed if you install flask and twilio however I am unsure.)
After all modules have been installed a virtual environment is required. Execute the script by typing "python app.py" in the virtual cmd or terminal.

# Where to find what
Each section has a hashed (#) comment explaining what the section does. By releasing this code I allow anybody to modify and use this script however it cannot be claimed as somebody else's.
